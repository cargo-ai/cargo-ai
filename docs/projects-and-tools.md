# Projects and local tools

[Documentation hub](./README.md) · [Cargo AI README](../README.md)

Cargo AI projects give agent definitions and source-backed tools one explicit local boundary. Use a project when an agent needs a reusable local capability behind a `kind: "tool"` step, or when you want to assemble agents, tools, and assets together later.

For exhaustive, version-matched assistant guidance, generate the offline bundle with `cargo ai add guidance` or read the repository sources under [`templates/guidance/`](../templates/guidance/). This page is the human workflow and safety guide.

## Create or initialize a project

Create a new project directory:

```bash
cargo ai new my-tool-project
cd my-tool-project
```

Or initialize the current directory:

```bash
cargo ai init
```

Add optional coding-assistant guidance with one or both discovery styles:

```bash
cargo ai add guidance --style codex
cargo ai add guidance --style claude
```

The project boundary is `.cargo-ai/project.toml`. Cargo AI discovers it from the current path and its ancestors. `cargo ai new` and `cargo ai init` create the project identity and tool policy; a combined manifest with optional runtime defaults can look like:

```toml
format_version = 1

[project]
name = "my_tool_project"
version = "0.1.0"

[tools]
allow_global_fallback = true

[runtime.defaults]
inference_timeout_in_sec = 600
max_runtime_in_sec = 600
max_agent_depth = 5
```

`cargo ai new` and `cargo ai init` write `allow_global_fallback = true`, which permits project commands to use machine-installed tools after project lookup. If you hand-author the manifest and omit the setting, Cargo AI treats the project as project-only. Set it explicitly to `false` when the project must refuse machine/global fallback:

```toml
[tools]
allow_global_fallback = false
```

Runtime defaults are optional. For repeated `run` workflows, precedence is:

- inference timeout: CLI override, project default, selected profile, built-in default;
- maximum runtime: CLI override, project default, built-in default;
- maximum agent depth: CLI override, project default, built-in default.

Maximum runtime and depth cascade through the invocation tree. Inference timeout stays local to an invocation unless a child explicitly selects a different profile or timeout.

See [Packages](./packages.md) for `[build.<profile>]`, package permissions, and hosted dependency declarations.

## Scaffold a Rust tool

When agent JSON alone is not enough and Cargo is available, prefer a generated Rust tool over an ad hoc Python, Node, or shell helper:

```bash
cargo ai add tool hello_tool
```

The scaffold separates author code from Cargo AI-managed protocol code:

```text
tools/hello_tool/
  Cargo.toml
  src/
    main.rs
    lib.rs
    agent_bridge.rs
    tool.rs
.cargo-ai/tools/hello_tool/tool.json
```

Cargo creates `Cargo.lock` later when it first resolves or builds the tool's dependencies.

Implement custom behavior in `tools/hello_tool/src/tool.rs`. Keep `src/main.rs` thin, and do not rewrite `src/lib.rs` or `src/agent_bridge.rs` unless you are deliberately changing the protocol adapter itself.

Define and validate:

- the tool description and examples;
- typed params and clear invalid-input errors;
- nullable-string result metadata;
- an accurate `resource_profile` for filesystem, network, subprocess, environment, credentials, UI, and background-process behavior;
- the `invoke` behavior and its failure modes.

Tool params may be `string`, `boolean`, `integer`, `number`, `array`, or `object`. Cargo AI validates only the top-level kind for arrays and objects; the tool owns deeper deserialization and shape validation. A step with `output_variable` requires the actual `invoke` result to be a non-null string even though the `describe` result schema is nullable.

## Build, inspect, and validate

Build the managed project artifact, then inspect both its contract and its integration with an agent:

```bash
cargo ai tools build hello_tool --target aarch64-apple-darwin
cargo ai tools describe hello_tool
cargo ai tools lint hello_tool
cargo ai tools check hello_tool
cargo ai tools check --config ./my_agent.json
cargo ai hatch my_agent --config ./my_agent.json --check
```

Use the target triple for the platform you are building. `tools lint` statically checks Cargo AI metadata linkage and source/scaffold expectations for a project-local source-backed tool. Machine-only and binary-only tools are not lint targets. `tools check` exercises the tool contract, while `hatch --check` validates the agent scaffold and compile path without exporting a binary.

Wire the tool into agent JSON with a tool action:

```json
{
  "kind": "tool",
  "name": "hello_tool",
  "params": {
    "name": "Cargo AI"
  },
  "output_variable": "greeting"
}
```

By default, `run`, `hatch --check`, and `hatch` audit referenced tools against their `describe` contracts before execution or compilation. They resolve project tools first and consult Cargo AI Home only when the manifest permits global fallback. Use `--ignore-tools` only when you intentionally accept a later failure if execution reaches an unavailable or incompatible tool.

Ordinary `cargo ai hatch` exports the agent binary only; it does not copy project tool artifacts beside the binary. A hatched binary launched inside a Cargo AI project uses the same project-first lookup. Outside a project, it can use machine-installed tools but not project-only tools.

`cargo ai tools build <name>` materializes managed state inside the current project. Reusable machine-scope installation goes through the [package workflow](./packages.md), not direct promotion of a local tool artifact.

## Generated state belongs to Cargo AI

Treat `.cargo-ai/tools/` and `.cargo-ai/agents/` as Cargo AI-owned generated state. Do not manually copy, move, rename, symlink, or delete files there while diagnosing a build or runtime problem.

If managed state was changed manually, stop using that workspace as evidence of a Cargo AI artifact defect. Reproduce from a fresh workspace or freshly regenerated state so the result is trustworthy.

Project bootstrap may add `.gitignore` entries for managed build state when version control is enabled. The separate `cargo ai add guidance` command creates `AGENTS.md` and/or `CLAUDE.md` discovery entrypoints plus `.cargo-ai/guidance/`, a self-contained, version-matched authoring bundle, and manages the related ignore entries.

The generated guidance bundle is the exhaustive offline assistant contract. This human guide summarizes the workflow without replacing that bundle.

## Tools that call child agents

New tool scaffolds include a Cargo AI-owned child-agent helper in `src/agent_bridge.rs`. Use it through the `InvocationContext` passed to `src/tool.rs` instead of hand-building subprocess flags, depth propagation, runtime-budget forwarding, or usage-ledger metadata.

```rust
let request = ChildAgentRequest::new("./child_agent.json")
    .add_text_input("hello from the tool");
context.invoke_agent(request)?;
```

The helper supports same-project child targets with same-level paths such as `./child_agent` or `./child_agent.json`. The tool step itself does not consume an additional agent-depth hop; each child call consumes depth as if the parent agent called that child directly. Remaining runtime budget and enabled usage-ledger context propagate to the child.

Manual `describe` or `invoke` calls outside a parent Cargo AI tool step do not include child-agent bridge context. Keep deterministic splitting and iteration in the tool, and model-driven work in the child agent.

See the generated-guidance sources for the complete contracts:

- [Tool authoring](../templates/guidance/tool-authoring.md)
- [Tool contract](../templates/guidance/tool-contract.md)
- [Tool child agents](../templates/guidance/tool-child-agents.md)
- [Tool hardening](../templates/guidance/tool-hardening.md)

## Validation ladder

Prove the smallest deterministic layer before moving upward:

1. use `cargo test` for crate-local Rust behavior;
2. run `cargo ai tools lint`, `describe`, `build`, and `check`;
3. validate the agent/tool pairing and run `hatch --check`;
4. test the leaf tool or child agent with deterministic input;
5. test tool-to-child fan-out;
6. test the parent orchestration path;
7. add live URLs or provider behavior;
8. perform real side effects last.

Do not keep changing higher layers while a lower layer is still failing. For UI and background-process tools, separate artifact creation from UI launch where practical, provide a smoke control such as `open_window=false`, and make process lifetime explicit. Use process inspection or termination only to clean up a specific long-lived child left by your own live run.

## Dependency and resource safety

Treat every tool dependency as trusted executable code. Prefer the standard library or stable, focused, actively maintained crates; enable only required features; and avoid Git/path dependencies, unpublished forks, prereleases, unnecessary build scripts, and unnecessary native dependencies unless the tradeoff is intentional.

Keep `Cargo.lock`, review the enabled dependency tree, and run available safety checks:

```bash
cargo tree -e features
cargo audit
cargo deny check
```

Before calling a tool complete, review parameter validation, errors, path traversal and overwrite behavior, network URLs and timeouts, authentication and data exposure, environment and credential reads, subprocess/UI lifetime, cleanup, and partial-output failure modes. The declared `resource_profile` must match the real behavior.
