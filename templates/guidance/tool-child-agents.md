# Cargo AI Tool Child Agents

Use this file when a project-local tool needs to call one or more same-project child agents.

## When To Use The Helper

New scaffolded tools receive an `InvocationContext` argument plus a Cargo AI-owned helper in `src/agent_bridge.rs`.

Use that helper when the tool needs procedural control such as:
- splitting or iterating over input values
- calling one or more same-project child agents in sequence
- keeping iterator or fan-out logic in Rust instead of expanding the agent JSON or relying on the model to do deterministic string processing

## Current Helper Shape

Use it from `src/tool.rs`:

```rust
let request = ChildAgentRequest::new("./child_agent.json")
    .add_text_input("hello from the tool");
context.invoke_agent(request)?;
```

## First-Slice Rules

- same-project child-agent targets only; use same-level relative paths such as `./child_agent` or `./child_agent.json`
- tool execution itself does not consume an extra agent-depth hop
- a child-agent call from the tool consumes depth exactly as if the parent had called that child directly
- the helper carries the remaining runtime budget through to the child-agent invocation
- when the parent run enables `--usage-log` or `CARGO_AI_USAGE_LOG`, the helper carries the usage-ledger path, root run id, parent agent run id, and tool-launch metadata into child-agent invocations
- manual direct `describe` or `invoke` calls outside a parent Cargo AI tool step will not include child-agent bridge context
- keep custom orchestration in `src/tool.rs`; do not rewrite `src/agent_bridge.rs`

## Authoring Guidance

- keep the tool responsible for deterministic orchestration and splitting
- keep the child agent responsible for model-driven work
- prefer the helper over hand-rolled subprocess flags, depth propagation, or runtime-budget forwarding
- keep custom business logging inside tool code when needed; Cargo AI's built-in usage log records only usage/timing metadata and never tool arguments, stdout/stderr, or child-agent payloads
