# Cargo AI Troubleshooting

Use this file when `cargo ai hatch <agent-name> --config <config.json> --check` reports an error.

## Common Problems

### Missing required top-level keys

Check that the JSON includes:
- `agent_definition_schema_version`
- `agent_schema`
- `actions`

`inputs` is optional. `actions: []` is valid for a model-only definition; a declared action must have a nonempty `run` list.

If the definition uses the legacy top-level `version` key, rename it to `agent_definition_schema_version` without changing its value. Copy schema-version values from current Cargo AI templates or guidance rather than inventing one from the current date or a package/project version.

### Unsupported version or unknown field

The supported strict revisions are `2026-09-09.r1` (ordinary scaffolds) and `2026-09-19.r1` (opt-in rubric). The former still rejects rubric and unknown fields. Valid revisions before `2026-09-09.r1` keep legacy parsing behavior. Every other revision at or after that cutoff produces `unsupported_schema_version`; check the intended contract or upgrade Cargo AI. Do not blindly replace an unsupported version header. Migration means reviewing and validating the complete definition.

For `unknown_field`, read the reported JSON path and allowed keys. Correct a misspelling or remove an unsupported field; move commentary into a sidecar Markdown file. The step platform key is `platform`, not `platforms`.

Strict schemas support only the subset in `agent-definition-contract.md`. Use `number`, not `num`. Do not add author-supplied `required`, `additionalProperties`, `format`, `$schema`, `$ref` or composition keywords. Cargo AI creates required-property and unknown-property provider metadata from the authored shape. No JSON Schema format assertions or remote schema-reference fetching are enabled.

For `unsupported_operator`, use a supported JSON Logic operator. `literal` is unsupported; `{ "==": [1, 1] }` expresses an unconditional true gate.

### Resource limit exceeded

Read `limit`, `maximum` and `observed` at the reported path. Reduce repeated/literal data or split the workflow to fit the limits in `agent-definition-contract.md`. JSON formatting whitespace does not count toward decoded key/string bytes. Do not change the version merely to bypass bounded validation.

### Structured output rejected

Check that model output contains every declared field, no unknown root or nested fields, and values matching declared types, enums and numeric bounds. Invalid output stops before downstream actions. A valid shape does not establish factual accuracy or trustworthiness; application-specific checks still belong in the workflow and tools.

### Wrong field for a step kind

Examples:
- `output_variable` on `agent` or `email_me`
- missing `program` for `exec`
- missing both `artifact` and legacy alias `agent`, or supplying both, for `kind: "agent"`
- missing `name` for `kind: "tool"`
- unsupported or misspelled `platform` values

### Bad variable references

Check for:
- collisions with top-level schema fields
- reusing the same captured variable name twice in one action
- using a captured variable before the step that creates it

### Path problems

Check for:
- absolute paths
- `../`
- local child targets that are not written as `./child_name`; installed package exports instead support `alias::entrypoint` (see [package workflow](package-workflow.md))

### Runtime input confusion

Check for:
- using `--input-file`, `--input-url`, or `--input-image` without also supplying `--input-text` when the instructions were only baked into JSON and the run is still using the default replace behavior
- expecting runtime input flags to append to JSON `inputs` without also setting `--input-mode append` or `--input-mode prepend`
- using a JSON `file.path` when the caller should really choose the file at invocation time

### Named input confusion

Check for:
- declaring a named input slot with `name` plus `type` but no baked value, then never satisfying it before use
- expecting anonymous runtime `--input-*` flags to satisfy a named input slot; use `--input-override NAME=VALUE` for that
- using anonymous runtime `--input-*` on a structural action-only agent, where the model call is skipped and only named top-level inputs remain valid
- referencing `{ "input": "<name>" }` from a child step when the parent did not declare that named top-level input
- expecting a child to forward a named input onward without declaring the same named input locally first
- using child `inputs` when the intent was really to target one declared named child slot directly; prefer child `input_overrides` for that
- expecting child `input_mode` to change child `input_overrides`; it only applies to anonymous child `inputs`

### Runtime variable confusion

Check for:
- using `runtime.<name>` without declaring `<name>` in top-level `runtime_vars`
- passing `--run-var` for a name that is not declared in `runtime_vars`
- forgetting `--run-var` for a declared runtime var that has no `default`
- passing an empty `--run-var` value for `boolean`, `integer`, or `number`
- forgetting to quote a `--run-var` value that contains spaces or shell-sensitive characters
- trying to use captured step vars in `generate_image.model`; that field only accepts literal strings plus top-level string schema fields and `runtime.*` in the current contract

### Tool workflow confusion

Check for:
- trying to run `cargo ai add tool <name>` outside a Cargo AI project with no `.cargo-ai/project.toml`
- forgetting to bootstrap the project boundary first with `cargo ai init` or `cargo ai new <path>`
- updating `tools/<tool_name>/src/tool.rs` but forgetting `cargo ai tools build <tool_name> --target <triple>`
- pulling a published project and assuming source-backed tools are already materialized as runnable binaries
- wiring agent JSON to a tool `name` that does not match the managed `tool.json`
- using param names or scalar types that do not match the tool `describe` contract
- setting `output_variable` on a tool step when the tool returns `result: null`
- omitting `result` from an `invoke` response; the response requires exactly `protocol_version` and `result`, even when the result is null
- returning an object or array as `result`; the supported result contract is string/null, so serialize structured application data into a declared string result
- expecting `--ignore-tools` to make a missing tool succeed; it only skips the upfront audit

### Project bootstrap confusion

Check for:
- expecting `cargo ai add guidance` or `cargo ai add tool` to create `.cargo-ai/project.toml`; use `cargo ai init` or `cargo ai new <path>` first
- expecting `cargo ai init/new` to install assistant guidance automatically; run `cargo ai add guidance --style codex`, `--style claude`, or both after bootstrap when you want a discovery entrypoint plus `.cargo-ai/guidance/`
- forgetting that `cargo ai init/new` defaults to `--vcs git`
- seeing a Git setup failure and missing the suggestion to either install Git or rerun with `--vcs none`

### Step did not run on the current OS

Check for:
- `platform` filtering the step out on the current runtime OS
- a macOS-only command being tested on another platform
- platform-specific assumptions that belong in sidecar notes

### Child-agent expectations

Check for:
- expecting parent actions to read child top-level output fields directly
- missing `status_variable` / `error_variable` when the parent needs to react to child success or failure
- expecting the parent to inline the entire child transcript; Cargo AI only surfaces child start/completion summaries plus any changed child `using:` line by default

### Runtime observability confusion

Check for:
- expecting a repeated `using:` line when the effective `profile`, `auth`, `server`, and `model` did not change from the last printed context
- expecting `url=...` to appear for the standard OpenAI API or ChatGPT account transports; custom endpoints show only their origin (scheme, host and optional port), omitting credentials, path, query and fragment
- assuming a child inherited the same context just because the parent emitted `child: started ...`; if the child changed context, look for a later child `using:` line

### Anthropic provider confusion

Check for:
- using a Claude.ai consumer subscription as if it supplied Console API credits or an API key; Anthropic bills Console API usage separately
- selecting `server = "anthropic"` with `auth = "none"` or `auth = "openai_account"`; use `auth = "api_key"`
- placing a real key in agent JSON or a command argument; store it with `cargo ai profile set <name> --stdin`
- using a model ID that the selected Anthropic Console organization cannot access
- setting `max_output_tokens` unusually low for a model with adaptive thinking; the cap includes thinking plus final text, so raise it if the provider returns no text block
- pointing a custom URL at an OpenAI-compatible facade; Cargo AI's `anthropic` adapter expects the native Messages request and response contract
- sending direct file input or selecting an Anthropic profile for a media run step; use a compatible media step profile
- assuming Cargo AI silently simplifies an unsupported JSON Schema; provider schema errors are surfaced so the authored contract remains visible

### Media run-step failures

- `generate_audio` needs speech text, a provider-specific voice ID, a supported WAV/MP3 output path, and an API-key profile. Gemini speech uses WAV only; Mistral needs an existing saved voice ID. xAI speech is a fixed service and rejects an explicit step model.
- `transcribe_audio.audio.path` is one literal relative path or one string variable reference. The source must be a readable, confined, regular WAV/MP3 file no larger than 10 MiB. Packaged literal sources must be declared assets; runtime-selected sources belong in package data.
- OpenAI account transport, Anthropic, Ollama, and TypeSafe have no speech or transcription adapter. Select a compatible API-key step profile; text model compatibility does not supply an audio route.
- A transcription capture is visible only to later steps in the same action. Use an action-only coordinator to transcribe before forwarding text to a child; root inference has already happened.
- Gemini image output must be PNG, xAI JPEG, and Mistral PNG without references. Returned image format, byte size, and image count are checked. Mistral may return no image when its model does not invoke the image tool.

## TypeSafe Jev compatibility failures

Use `hatch NAME --config FILE --check --profile jev` to assess declared schema/input kinds/settings. The check profile is metadata-only and does not lock runtime selection. Static success does not prove credentials, live model availability, context fit, fetched input content, runtime overrides, child selections or judgment quality.

- `rubric` rejected: use opt-in `2026-09-19.r1` only for top-level `number`, with nonblank description, 2–10 ordered nonblank strings and finite inclusive `minimum < maximum` with finite span. No exclusive bounds or nested/integer rubric. Invalid rubrics fail on every provider.
- Ordinary number rejected by Jev: add meaningful rubric levels if scoring is the intended task, or select a provider supporting ordinary numeric output. Bounds alone never imply scoring. Boolean/Noul, free-form and structured outputs are unsupported; do not remove fields silently.
- Input rejected: Jev accepts text and client-fetched URL text only. Do not silently convert image/file inputs. Runtime overrides can invalidate a prior static result.
- Unsupported setting: run `cargo ai profile set jev --clear-temperature` and/or `cargo ai profile set jev --clear-max-output-tokens`; inherited settings count too.
- Missing/invalid response: preserve the failure. Missing/extra answer IDs, invalid labels/types or out-of-range scores stop downstream actions. Scores are never clamped. No automatic retry or fallback is added.
- Context/auth/rate-limit/service failure: check the selected model, account access and provider limits; no exact local tokenizer certifies token fit. Never include keys or raw input payloads in shared diagnostics.
- Hosted save fails for a rubric definition: new revision `2026-09-19.r1` is supported for local/hatch execution only; hosted storage is deferred. Keep ordinary scaffolds on `2026-09-09.r1` when no rubric is needed. Do not change the version header without reviewing the whole contract.

A valid score is not a calibrated confidence/probability. Check representative labeled judgments; the syntax check cannot assess rubric quality. Failed children cannot undo prior actions.

### Mistral API provider confusion

Check for:
- selecting `server = "mistral"` with `auth = "none"` or `auth = "openai_account"`; use `auth = "api_key"`
- exhausting Mistral Studio Free-mode usage or rate limits, selecting a model the account cannot access, or using the Scale API Plan before its billing is active; check the organization's API Plan plus Usage and limits pages
- pointing a custom text-inference URL at a native Mistral service other than Chat Completions; text inference expects `/v1/chat/completions`, while media routes derive from that configured API origin
- sending image/file input to Mistral text inference, or asking its image tool for references; its media actions have separate native routes and limitations
- assuming OpenAI-compatible transport changes the provider identity; diagnostics and usage must still report `mistral`
- treating a representative smoke model as certification of every Mistral model; model selection and model capabilities remain operator-controlled
- retrying with weakened JSON or another model after a schema rejection; Cargo AI preserves the authored schema and fails closed

### xAI provider confusion

Check for:
- selecting `server = "xai"` with `auth = "none"` or `auth = "openai_account"`; use `auth = "api_key"`
- using `server = "grok"`; `xai` is the provider value and Grok is the model family
- pointing a custom URL at Chat Completions; this adapter expects xAI Responses and sends `store = false`
- sending image/file input to xAI text inference, enabling provider-hosted text tools, or requesting a non-JPEG xAI image output; its media actions use separate native routes
- treating a representative smoke model as certification of every Grok model; model selection and model capabilities remain operator-controlled
- retrying with weakened JSON, another model, or another provider after a schema rejection; Cargo AI preserves the authored schema and fails closed before actions

### Gemini provider confusion

Check for:
- selecting `server = "gemini"` with `auth = "none"` or `auth = "openai_account"`; use `auth = "api_key"`
- placing a Google AI Studio key in agent JSON or a command argument; store it with `cargo ai profile set <name> --stdin`
- using a model ID that the selected Google AI project cannot access
- pointing a custom URL at `generateContent` or an OpenAI-compatible facade; Cargo AI's `gemini` adapter expects the native Interactions request and response contract
- expecting provider-side conversation storage; Cargo AI sends `store = false` for each Gemini request
- sending generic direct file input to Gemini text inference or requesting a non-PNG Gemini generated image; its media actions use native Interactions routes
- assuming Cargo AI silently simplifies an unsupported JSON Schema; provider schema errors are surfaced so the authored contract remains visible

### Portability drift

If the user asked for portability across macOS, Windows, and Linux:
- remove shell-specific assumptions when possible
- minimize `exec` usage
- keep commands and paths as generic as possible

If the user asked for macOS-only local behavior:
- prefer `/bin/echo` or another explicit executable over a bare shell builtin
- pair the step with `platform: "macos"` when the step should not run elsewhere

## Default Fix Loop

1. Read the stable error code, JSON field path, expected keys and corrective action.
2. Fix one problem at a time.
3. Re-run:
   - `cargo ai hatch <agent-name> --config <config.json> --check`
4. Build only after the check passes.

## When To Add Sidecar Notes

If the JSON is technically valid but hard to explain:
- add a same-name sidecar Markdown file
- add an ASCII diagram near the top
- record any platform-specific assumptions there
