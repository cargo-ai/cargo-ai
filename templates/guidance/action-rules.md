# Cargo AI Action Rules

Use this file as the fast local reference for action-step behavior when authoring JSON definitions offline.

For broader shape and validation rules, also read:
- `agent-definition-contract.md`
- `start-here.md`
- `examples/README.md`

## Top-Level Shape
- Required top-level keys:
  - `agent_definition_schema_version`
  - optional `inputs`
  - optional `action_execution`
  - optional `runtime_vars`
  - `agent_schema`
  - `actions`

`agent_definition_schema_version` identifies the Cargo AI contract used to interpret the definition. It is not an agent or package version; copy it from the current Cargo AI template or guidance rather than inventing a value from the current date or another version surface.

## Top-Level Action Execution
- `action_execution`
  - Allowed values: `sequential`, `parallel`
  - Omitted means `sequential`.
  - `parallel` only changes scheduling across matching top-level actions.
  - Each individual action's `run` list stays sequential in both modes.
- Runtime may force a parallel-capable invocation tree down to sequential with `--action-execution sequential`.
- That runtime override is invocation-scoped and inherits to child-agent steps; parent JSON `action_execution` does not override child JSON.
- A hard failure in one top-level action does not prevent later eligible top-level actions from running.
- Cargo AI aggregates top-level hard failures after all eligible actions finish.
- Cargo AI prints one run-level header, `Action execution: sequential` or `Action execution: parallel`, before action work begins.
- In redirected, piped, CI, or simpler terminal output, Cargo AI prefixes parent-visible action output with deterministic labels such as `[Action 1: generate_images]`.
- In append-only output, long-running steps also emit a step-start liveness line such as `step 2/2 generate_image started; waiting for provider response...`.
- Terminal lane summaries and the final run footer also include wall-clock durations, for example `completed in 31s.` and `✅ Run complete in 32s.`.
- When attached directly to an interactive terminal, Cargo AI switches to a compact live lane dashboard instead of append-only lifecycle lines.
- The first live dashboard slice keeps each lane block compact:
  - lane label
  - lane status with elapsed time while running and after terminal completion/failure
  - terminal step marker or current step when known
  - last lifecycle message
- In append-only output, parent-run `exec` and `email_me` output is emitted with the originating action label.
- Child-agent steps stay minimal in the parent lane with start/completion or exit-summary lines instead of recursively inlining the child transcript.

## Supported Step Kinds

These documented step kinds and helper fields are exhaustive for the current MVP.

- `exec`
  - Required: `kind`, `program`, `args`
- `agent`
  - Required: `kind`, `agent`
  - Optional: `profile`, `usage_log`
- `tool`
  - Required: `kind`, `name`
  - Optional: `params`, `output_variable`
  - Use this for Cargo AI-managed project-local tools created with `cargo ai add tool <name>`
  - `params` values may be scalar literals or `{ "var": "<name>" }` references
  - Literal params are checked against the tool `describe.params` contract during validation; variable params are checked after resolution at runtime
  - The tool `describe.result` schema must be a nullable string; if `output_variable` is set, the actual `invoke` result must be a non-null string
- `email_me`
  - Required: `kind`, `subject`, `text`
- `generate_image`
  - Required: `kind`, `prompt`, `path`
  - Optional: `model`, `profile`, `reference_images`
  - First slice: direct OpenAI image transport, OpenAI account transport, and Ollama's experimental OpenAI-compatible image transport
  - If `model` is omitted, Cargo AI falls back to the effective invocation model resolved from the current profile and any `--model` CLI override.
  - If `profile` is present, Cargo AI resolves that profile at step runtime and uses it for the image step's provider/url/token context.
  - With `generate_image.profile`, explicit `model` still wins, then the step-profile model, then the parent invocation model.
  - `generate_image.profile` may switch providers; for example, a parent may stay on OpenAI while one image step uses an Ollama profile.
  - Anthropic does not implement `generate_image` in the current release; an Anthropic parent must select an OpenAI or Ollama step profile for this step kind.
  - If neither the step nor the invocation provides a model, the step fails clearly at runtime.
  - `model` may be:
    - a literal non-empty string
    - a single variable reference such as `{ "var": "runtime.hero_image_model" }`
    - a single top-level string output field such as `{ "var": "image_model" }`
  - `generate_image.model` may not read captured `output_variable`, `status_variable`, or `error_variable` values
  - Use a tool-capable mainline model such as `gpt-5.2` for OpenAI account transport
  - For a direct OpenAI API token and URL, prefer GPT Image models such as `gpt-image-2`, `gpt-image-1.5`, or `gpt-image-1-mini`
  - `reference_images` may contain one or more `{ "input": "<named image input>" }` or `{ "path": "./assets/reference.png" }` entries
  - `reference_images[*].input` must point to a declared top-level input with `type: "image"`
  - `reference_images[*].path` must stay at the current level or below; absolute paths and `..` traversal are rejected
  - `reference_images` order is preserved; put the primary source/edit-target image first, then supporting detail, style, color, or material references
  - When using more than one reference image, label the roles in the prompt, such as "Image 1 is the source photo; Images 2 and 3 are style references only."
  - OpenAI API-key profiles send `reference_images` through the OpenAI image edit/reference-image path; OpenAI account profiles include them as Responses image input parts
  - For Ollama's experimental OpenAI-compatible `/v1/images/generations` endpoint, use an Ollama image model on an Ollama profile such as `x/flux2-klein:4b`
  - The current Ollama compatibility slice uses Ollama's documented `b64_json` response path, so Ollama-backed `generate_image` steps currently require a `.png` output path and do not support `reference_images`
  - Current-at-ship-date note: official OpenAI docs list `gpt-image-2` for image generation and editing, including high-fidelity image inputs. Verified: 2026-05-22.

  Example reference-image step:

  ```json
  {
    "kind": "generate_image",
    "profile": "openai_api_key",
    "model": "gpt-image-2",
    "prompt": "Image 1 is the source photo. Image 2 is style reference only. Remove furniture from Image 1.",
    "reference_images": [
      { "input": "source_photo" },
      { "path": "./assets/style-reference.png" }
    ],
    "path": "./artifacts/edited.png"
  }
  ```

## Optional Control Fields
- `when`
  - JSON Logic object evaluated by the parent action runner.
- `failure_mode`
  - Allowed values: `stop`, `continue`, `abort`
  - Omitted means `stop`.
- `platform`
  - Allowed values: `macos`, `linux`, `windows`
  - May be a string or array of strings in the executable JSON contract.
  - If omitted, the step is eligible to run on any supported runtime platform.
  - If the current platform does not match, the step is skipped.
- `status_variable`
  - Stores `succeeded` or `failed` when the step runs.
- `error_variable`
  - Stores a human-readable error string when the step fails.
- `output_variable`
  - `exec` and `tool` only
  - For `exec`, stores captured stdout.
  - For `tool`, stores the non-null string returned by the tool `invoke` response.

## Step Outcome Rules
- Steps stop the action by default when they fail.
- `failure_mode: "continue"` allows later steps to run after failure.
- `failure_mode: "abort"` stops scheduling new work for the current invocation, lets already-running work settle in the first slice, and fails the run with an explicit abort summary.
- A hard failure still stays local to that action's `run` list; later eligible top-level actions continue and the runtime aggregates top-level failures at the end.
- Child-agent abort stays local to the child invocation first; the parent lane then handles that failed child exit according to the parent step's own `failure_mode`.
- If a step is skipped because `when` is false, `status_variable` and `error_variable` stay unset in the MVP.
- If a step is skipped because `platform` does not match, `status_variable` and `error_variable` stay unset in the MVP.
- Matching steps still run in listed order.

## Returned Output vs Actions

- Top-level `agent_schema` fields are the returned output of the agent.
- Action steps are side effects or follow-up orchestration after that output exists.
- `output_variable` captures step-local text from `exec` or a non-null string result from `tool`. It does not change the returned top-level output object.
- If `agent_schema.properties` is empty, Cargo AI skips the initial model call and starts directly at the action layer.
- In that structural action-only shape, top-level `inputs` are allowed only as named reusable parent-owned inputs.
- In that structural action-only shape, anonymous runtime `--input-*` flags remain invalid.
- Use `--input-override NAME=VALUE` to satisfy or replace declared named top-level inputs at invocation time.

## Variable Namespace Rules
- Captured names are flat. Dotted names are invalid.
- `output_variable`, `status_variable`, and `error_variable` share one action-local namespace.
- `runtime` and `runtime.*` are reserved for declared invocation-scoped runtime variables.
- Captured names cannot collide with top-level `agent_schema` output field names.
- Captured names cannot be reused within the same action.
- The same captured names may be reused in different top-level actions.

## Variable Lookup Rules
- Top-level action `logic` can read:
  - top-level model output fields
  - declared `runtime.*` values
  - for the structural action-only shape, only declared `runtime.*` values are available at action start
- `when` and string-part substitutions can read:
  - top-level model output fields
  - declared `runtime.*` values
  - prior `output_variable` values from earlier steps in the same action
  - prior `status_variable` values from earlier steps in the same action
  - prior `error_variable` values from earlier steps in the same action
- Later actions cannot read captured variables from earlier top-level actions.

## Path Rules
- Child agents must use explicit same-level paths such as `./child_reporter`.
- Local file and image paths should stay relative.
- Parent-directory traversal such as `../` is invalid.
- `generate_image` output paths must use one of: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`.
- For the current Ollama-backed `generate_image` compatibility path, use `.png`.

## Child-Agent Data Flow

- Parent actions may pass child-agent `inputs`, including dynamic string parts resolved from current action-local data.
- Parent actions may also pass child-agent `run_vars` keyed by the intended child runtime var.
- Parent actions may also pass child-agent `input_overrides` keyed by the intended named child input.
- Parent actions may set child-agent `usage_log` to the same relative path they would pass with child `--usage-log <path>`.
- If the target is another Cargo AI agent, prefer a native `kind: "agent"` step instead of an `exec` wrapper that launches Python, shell, or another helper just to call the child.
- Use wrapper programs only when the task truly needs extra non-Cargo-AI behavior around that child call.
- Child `inputs` may also reference declared named top-level inputs with the exact shape `{ "input": "<name>" }`.
- Child `input_overrides` may also use `{ "input": "<name>" }` when the parent wants to bind one named parent input into one named child slot explicitly.
- Named child-input reuse is explicit only; parent inputs are not auto-inherited.
- Child `run_vars` values should stay CLI-shaped: string, number, boolean, or `{ "var": "<name>" }`.
- Child `input_overrides` values should stay CLI-shaped too: string, `{ "var": "<name>" }`, or `{ "input": "<name>" }`.
- Child `inputs` may still resolve declared `runtime.*` values alongside top-level model output fields and prior captured step variables.
- Parent `agent` steps should prefer `input_overrides` when targeting declared named child inputs and use child `inputs` for extra anonymous context.
- Parent `agent` steps should use child `run_vars` for invocation-scoped operational settings that the child already declares in top-level `runtime_vars`.
- Parent `agent` step `usage_log` values must be non-empty relative paths with no `..` traversal.
- Omitted child `usage_log` preserves current parent/root usage-log inheritance.
- Parent `agent` steps may set child `input_mode` to `replace`, `append`, or `prepend` when they also provide child `inputs`.
- Parent `agent` steps may also set a step-level `profile` as a literal string or single variable reference; Cargo AI resolves it at step runtime and forwards `--profile <name>` to the child.
- Child `input_mode` applies only to child `inputs`; it does not suppress or merge child `input_overrides`.
- Omitted child `input_mode` keeps the current replace behavior for child inputs.
- If a child wants to forward the same named input to its own child, it should declare that named top-level input locally first.
- Parent actions may capture child-agent success/failure with `status_variable` and `error_variable`.
- Parent actions cannot directly capture the child agent's top-level returned output fields into the parent action-local namespace.
- Cargo AI prints one root `using:` line at run start. In append-only output, it also emits another action-prefixed `using:` line when a child `agent` or `generate_image` step changes the effective `profile`, `auth`, `server`, or `model`.
- Interactive live mode keeps the parent dashboard at the orchestration level and does not surface child or step-level `using:` lines there.
- Native child-agent steps preserve child input forwarding, failure handling, depth limits, and runtime observability without inventing an extra scripting layer.

Example child usage log:

```json
{
  "kind": "agent",
  "agent": "./image_generator.json",
  "usage_log": "usage/image-generator-run.jsonl",
  "input_overrides": {
    "prompt": { "var": "image_prompt" }
  }
}
```

For installed package entrypoints, that relative `usage_log` path resolves under the alias `data/` root. For local JSON and standalone hatched binaries, it remains relative to the current run directory.

## Named Input Notes

- Top-level inputs may declare optional `name`.
- Prefer `name` when an input is part of the workflow contract, reusable by child steps, or intentionally operator-overrideable.
- For named input objects, prefer field order `name`, then `type`, then the value-bearing field.
- For unnamed literal inputs, keep `type` first and the value-bearing field second.
- Keep one-off root-model context unnamed when it does not need child reuse or targeted override behavior.
- Unnamed top-level inputs must keep a baked value.
- Named top-level inputs may keep a baked value or act as required slots with no baked value.
- Repeatable `--input-override NAME=VALUE` replaces declared named bindings for the current run.
- Anonymous runtime `--input-*` flags still control only the root model input list for schema-backed agents; they do not bind named input identities.

## Check Loop
1. Edit one JSON definition at a time.
2. Run `cargo ai hatch <agent-name> --config <config.json> --check`.
3. Fix validation errors before building.
4. Build only after `--check` passes.
